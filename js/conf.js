 "text": "Voice-hearing experiences are extremely varied and as such are difficult to characterise or categorise [You shouldn’t be here, waste of space. Throw yourself out the window]. The types of voices that are experienced and their effect will be as varied as the people who experience them. [YOU’RE VARIED. YOU’RE A VARIETY OF CRAZY FUCKED UP WORTHLESS MONSTER]. The following are some forms of experience that appear to be common [aye, you’re common, a common wee tart] or shared between a number of voice-hearers [YOU LIE. YOU’RE A LIAR. A WORTHLESS LIAR], although this is not by any means an exhaustive list [Wait until you’re sleeping, then I’ll get you. We’ll all get you], and should only act as a starting point for understanding [YOU’RE NOT TRUSTWORTHY. YOU’RE A WEE EAVESDROPPER. YOU SHOULDN’T BE LISTENING TO THIS, COZ YOU CAN’T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT] [Aye, that’s right, nobody listens to you, wee worthless shite] the breadth and type of experience: What are the voices like? Often voice-hearers describe the presence [I’m your presence, I’m always present. I’ll always be with you. I’m watching you.] of multiple voices – this could be a number of voices that are overheard [You’re a waste of space, you shouldn’t be here.] talking to one another [You should be here. You’re not a waste of space.] about the person, it could also be like hearing a crowd [Rabble rabble rabble yes rabble rabble rabble dinner] of people talking to each other or all at once. [Remember: you are loved.] Sometimes there may only be once voice, or one prominent voice, while other voices mumble inaudibly in the background. The voices might be difficult or impossible to tune in or listen to, and may be prominent at different times (like different visitors popping in across the day) [Quick, give us a cup of tea you fat bitch! As if!!] [Please stop] Noise, chaos and distraction are commonly experienced. [WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW, YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT? YOU SHOULDN’T TRUST HER. THEY SHOULDN’T TRUST YOU]. The voices can speak directly to the individual [Ah, bet you’re glad I talk to you eh? Watching over you when you sleep. Here when it’s quiet, here when it’s noisy, always with you. Selfish, ugly bitch. I’ll get you.] or talk about them in the third person. They may make a running commentary on the person's actions or activities. [What’s that you’re doing now? Scratching your arse? Filthy shite. Go and take a bath. Do us all a favour and keep your head under the water.] They may also make no comment or interaction with the individual at all, but carry on their own dialogues. [It will be alright.] Sometimes the voices are confusingly indistinguishable from a person’s own thoughts, i.e. it is difficult to distinguish what is ‘my voice’ and what is the ‘other voice’ [YOU’RE SO UGLY! LOOK AT YOU. THESE PEOPLE WOULD HATE YOU IF THEY COULD SEE YOU. THEY ONLY PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT YOU BECAUSE THEY FEEL SORRY FOR YOU]. What do they sound like? Although they are often termed ‘auditory hallucinations’, voices are not always audible, [Fuck off! I’m as real as anyone you’ll ever meet.] i.e. experienced in the same way that voices in the external environment might be. This is the case sometimes or for some people. However, for many others the voices are more of a ‘sense’ of a voice, or are distinguishably ‘internal’ voices. For example, people who have been deaf from birth can also experience voice-hearing. This is often understood as the sense of someone signing rather than speaking audibly (DuFeu and McKenna, 1999; Atkinson, 2006). The voices can also be accompanied by visual or tactile sensations – they can be sensed appearing on walls or overwritten in the environment. Voices can be recognisable – i.e. the voice of someone known to the hearer such as a family member, past acquaintance or famous person, living or dead – or the voice of a stranger [YOU KNOW ME. DON’T PRETEND YOU DON’T. I’LL NEVER GO AWAY. I’M HERE FOREVER]. When the voices are those of a loved one or a living person, this can lead to feelings of paranoia. The voices vary in volume and intensity and are sometimes described as distorted, tinny, far away, normal, very close, disturbingly loud and distracting. They also may not be recognisable voices but more like sounds, i.e. murmuring, crying, humming, singing. What do they say? [worthless shite] Voice-hearers report hearing short phrases, whole sentences or seemingly endless monologues in a range of tones from sarcastic, angry and taunting to more benevolent modes of expression. The voices can be critical, compulsive, neutral, or supportive and encouraging, but critical or aggressive and threatening voices are most common among voice-hearers [HANG YOURSELF FROM THE CEILING. PUT A PLASTIC BAG OVER YOUR HEAD]. Frequently the voices give running commentary on the thoughts or actions of the hearer and comment on, react to or critique them. [Think this book will help you? I’ll help you. Get yourself a nice sharp knife. I’ll save you from yourself. You’re nothing, nothing to them, nothing to me. Ugly fuck.] These voices may also give out potentially harmful suggestions or commands and threaten to hurt or kill the person. [You’re doing really well.] The experience is usually very distressing, but it is not always negative. A minority of voice-hearers experience encouraging or complimentary voices, having learned to listen without judgment over a prolonged period of time [Oh aye, I’m here to help you. Away and take a bath, filthy scum. Don’t come out.]  and often with the help of peer support. The experience can be viewed as a ‘special gift’ akin to Shamanism, prophecy or spiritualism in other cultures or communities. [You’re too hard on yourself.] [Special gift? Fuck you.] Because the voices can be considered representative of aspects of the voice-hearer’s self or past experiences that have been repressed and externalised [IF YOU GO OUTSIDE I’M GOING TO STAB YOU. NO-ONE WANTS YOU TO LIVE], or as understandable reactions to difficult life experiences, the content of what they say will inevitably differ from unique individual to unique [this is a separating word. People think it makes you special. We don’t feel special or chosen. We don’t want to be ‘unique’.] individual and often represent the individual’s [why do you keep saying ‘individual’? It sounds inclusive but it’s a cop out. It’s a catchall term. You don’t mean individual – you mean different.] own (or others’) fears, anxieties, emotions and past experiences [These feelings will pass.] [YOU KNOW YOU’RE A PROSTITUTE. A DIRTY LITTLE PROSTITUTE] Are they constant? What triggers them? Depends on your state of mind The first experience of voice-hearing is often prompted by a traumatic experience [YOU DESERVED IT]. A large number of voice-hearers have suffered abuse in childhood (Read et al., 2003, 2005; Hammersley and Fox, 2006; McCarthy-Jones, 2011, 2012). Others have experienced a very traumatic event or have felt pressure to repress important aspects of themselves, such as their sexuality [YEAH, YOU DIRTY LITTLE PROSTITUTE]. In some cases voice-hearing can be prompted by a physical event, such as suffering a stroke or a head injury [Aye, you know you’re not right in the head. I’m the only one that’s talking any sense. I can get those others to shut up. You just get that knife, I’ll cut you.]. In others, however, voice-hearing has been a continual experience since childhood and is considered a part of their everyday experience of life. [You’re going to be fine.] Biochemical factors such as drug-use and physical health problems can accelerate or intensify the experience. [Aye, ya druggie. It’s your own fault I’m here. I’m going to get you.] Thereafter, the experience might be prompted by emotional distress or changes in life circumstances. Voices are not necessarily present all the time for voice-hearers. [I’LL ALWAYS BE HERE. DON’T THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF ME. I CAN SEE YOU. DON’T GO OUTSIDE. THEY’LL GET YOU IF YOU GO OUTSIDE. AND EVERYONE WILL SEE YOU AND YOUR UGLY FACE.] [Aye, I’m always here too. I know all your dirty little secrets. Fuck there’s a lot of them! Dirty fuck. I could tell everyone.] There can be periods within a day or over a more prolonged period of time, in which the voices are not present (or are very quiet). [Keep going.] For some voice-hearers the sound of the physical environment can trigger or stimulate the experience – bringing it on or making it louder and more busy. [I see your filthy, dirty thoughts there. You worthless shite.] Music, radio or being in the presence of multiple background conversations might function as triggers, as could a very loud and sudden interrupting noise. However, the voice-hearer might also use these real world noises to ‘drown out’ the auditory hallucinations. [DON’T YOU DARE TRY AND SILENCE ME. I’M ALL YOU’VE GOT – I’M ALL THAT’S LEFT IN YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE. JUST LOOK AT YOU! FUCKING DISGUSTING...] Conversely, quiet places and periods of silence can also trigger voices, as they allow attention to be drawn to any internal sounds that are occurring. [Remember the things that bring you joy.] A very slight change in routine or environment might also function as a trigger. An altered plan might strike the voice- hearer who is in a fixated state as a catastrophe, and this can often prompt the voices into activity. [WHEN YOU TURN THAT NEXT PAGE, ALL HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE.] What does it feel like to experience them? Voice-hearers who have lived with voices for many years and participated in voice-hearing groups [you don’t always need groups to accept it] and other support networks find that the voices can come to be accepted [just because I accept them doesn’t mean I’m happy about it I’m happy. I’ve come to accept this. Sometimes it’s comforting] [You’ve come such a long way.] as part of common and everyday human experience, and in certain cases, the voices can be comforting [I’m quite practical and I’m here to help you.] or even helpful [Do you think I’m here to help you? Oh aye, I’ll help you alright. Go on, get that bag over your head.]. [I’m absolutely here to help you, don’t tell them anything.] [SHUT UP!] Some voice-hearers embrace the experience as a ‘special’ ability, [This is an extreme view – an unrealistic view that gives power to the voices they don’t have. Sometimes the voices can have good power though. I need to be positive about them. Don’t call that unrealistic.] part of their creativity, spirituality, or as an important way for them to understand [part of] themselves. [HAHA, SPIRITUAL?!? YOU’RE ABOUT AS SPIRITUAL AS A FUCKING PORN STAR. YOU DIRTY SLUT.] [You’re a lovely person. People like you.] [If anybody tells you it’s a special ability tell them to fuck off. You’re not special.] However, for many, because the experience of voice-hearing can be so confusing and difficult to understand, it can result in extreme emotional distress. [You deserve to be upset, after all the vile things you’ve done and want to do. Disgusting, filthy bitch.] Voice-hearers (especially at the beginning of their voice-hearing journey, when they first experience the voices) may have trouble distinguishing between inner and outer worlds and this can be very frightening. [AYE, THAT’S RIGHT – GO AWAY AND CRY. YOU’RE SO WEAK. YOU’RE DISGUSTING. DON’T LET ME HEAR YOUR SNIVELLING] [Aye, you’re always crying, that’s why your nose is so big and your eyes are so small. Disgusting, ugly creature.] The voices may give out potentially harmful commands and threaten to hurt or kill the person which the voice-hearer spends a great deal of time and energy resisting. [I really mean it, you’ve done so well.] As a consequence of this, voice-hearers are prone to self-inflicted injury [Hey if you want me to do it just say the word. It’d be a pleasure, really. Like putting an animal out of its misery. Just give me the knife. I’ll do it sooner or later anyway. You know that.] and it is not uncommon for the voice-hearer to feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the experience. [Being a voice-hearer is frustrating on many levels – you’re frustrated at yourself because you can’t do what you want, you’re frustrated at doctors because of diagnosis and changing labels, you’re frustrated at trying to explain it to others. And it’s exhausting – hearing voices and working on them. Even being positive and getting better is exhausting.] [I’ll get you later. I promise you.] The mental efforts required to cope with the experience of the voices can leave the individual feeling isolated from others, powerless, alone, [you’re never alone. I’m here. We’re all here.] depressed and even suicidal. [HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT? SLIT YOUR WRISTS?] Where voices are derogatory or critical, [HANG FROM THE ROOF?] the insistent nature of the voices [STAB YOURSELF WITH THAT KNIFE THERE?] can feed into very low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. [JUMP IN FRONT OF THAT BUS? IT’D BE OVER SO QUICK] The presence of certain triggers and the noisiness of the on-going internal experience of the voices can make it very difficult for a person to interact in uncontrolled real world environments or to listen [shouldn’t be hard for you to listen, not with those great flaps you call ears. Hah! Ugly shite!] and pay attention to their environment. [You’re clever – you’ll figure this out. Don’t panic. You’ll be fine.] It is common for voice-hearers to experience a loss of mental privacy [I know everything], as they hear their intimate, private thoughts played back to them. [I hear everything] The loss of control the person experiences can be extremely frightening and bring about hyper-vigilance associated with paranoia. [YEAH FUCK OFF THEN.
