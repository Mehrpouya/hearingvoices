Voice-hearing experiences are extremely varied and as such are difficult to characterise or categorise. ~~++01You shouldn't be here. ~~++01waste of space. ~~throw yourself out the window. The types of voices that are experienced and their effect will be as varied as the people who experience them. ~~++02YOU’RE VARIED. ~~++02YOU’RE A VARIETY OF CRAZY FUCKED UP WORTHLESS MONSTER. The following are some forms of experience that appear to be common ~~++03aye, you're common, a common wee tart. or shared between a number of voice-hearers ~~++04YOU LIE. ~~++04YOU’RE A LIAR. ~~A WORTHLESS LIAR. although this is not by any means an exhaustive list ~~++05Wait until you're sleeping, then I'll get you. ~~We'll all get you.  and should only act as a starting point for understanding ~~++06YOU’RE NOT TRUSTWORTHY. ~~YOU’RE A WEE EAVESDROPPER. ~~YOU SHOULDN’T BE ++07LISTENING TO THIS, COZ YOU CAN’T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. ~~Aye,that's right, nobody listens to you, wee ++08worthless shite. the breadth and type of experience. $$What are the voices like? Often voice-hearers describe the presence ~~++09I'm your presence, ~~I'm ++10always present. ~~I'll always be with you. ~~++10I'm watching you. of multiple voices – this could be a number of voices that are overheard ~~++01You’re a waste of space, you shouldn’t be here. talking to one another ~~++11You should be here. ~~You’re not a ++11waste of space. about the person, it could also be like hearing a crowd ~~Rabble rabble rabble yes rabble rabble rabble dinner. of people talking to each other or all at once. ~~++12Remember: you are loved. Sometimes there may only be one voice, or one prominent voice, while other voices mumble inaudibly in the background. The voices might be difficult or impossible to tune in or listen to, and may be prominent at different times (like different visitors popping in across the day). ~~++13Quick ! ~~++13give us a cup of ++13tea you ++13fat ++13bitch! ~~As iF!!! ~~Please stop. Noise, chaos and distraction are commonly experienced. ~~WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW YOU ++04LYING PIECE OF ++08SHIT? ~~YOU SHOULDN’T TRUST HER. ~~THEY SHOULDN’T TRUST YOU. The voices can speak directly to the individual ~~++10Ah, bet you're glad I talk to you eh? ~~Watching over you when you sleep. ~~Here when it's quiet, here when it's noisy, always with you. ~~+-Selfish, ugly bitch. ~~++02I'll get you. or talk about them in the third person. They may make a running commentary on the person’s actions or activities. ~~++18What's that you're doing now? ~~++18Scratching your arse? ~~+-Filthy shite. ~~++16Go and take a bath. ~~++17Do us all a favour and keep your head under the water. They may also make no comment or interaction with the ~~It will be ++14alright --individual --at --all, --but --carry --on --their --own --dialogues. Sometimes the voices are confusingly indistinguishable from a person’s own thoughts %% it is difficult to distinguish what is ‘my voice’ and what is the ‘other voice’. ~~++16YOU’RE SO +-UGLY! ~~LOOK AT YOU. ~~THESE ++05PEOPLE WOULD +-HATE YOU IF THEY COULD SEE YOU. ~~THEY ONLY +-PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT YOU BECAUSE THEY feel +-SORRY FOR YOU. $$Are they constant| What triggers them? ~~Depends on your state of mind. The first experience of voice-hearing is often prompted by a traumatic experience ~~++02YOU DESERVED IT. A large number of voice-hearers have suffered abuse in childhood. Others have experienced a very traumatic event or have felt pressure to repress important aspects of themselves, such as their sexuality. ~~++03YEAH, YOU DIRTY LITTLE PROSTITUTE. In some cases voice-hearing can be prompted by a physical event, such as suffering a stroke or a head injury. ~~++09Aye, you know you're not right in the head. ~~++11I'm the only one that's talking any +-sense. ~~++19I can get those others to ++13shut up. ~~You just get that +-knife. ~~++13I'll ++13cut you. In others, however, voice-hearing has been a continual experience since childhood and is considered a part of their everyday experience of life. ~~++15You’re going to be +-fine. Biochemical factors such as drug use and physical health problems can accelerate or intensify the experience. ~~Aye, ya druggie. ~~It's your own fault ++19I'm here. ~~++05I'm going to get you. Thereafter, the experience might be prompted by emotional distress or changes in life circumstances. Voices are not necessarily present all the time for voice-hearers. ~~++10I’LL ALWAYS BE HERE. ~~++10DON’T +-THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF ME. ~~I CAN +-SEE YOU. ~~DON’T GO OUTSIDE. ~~THEY’LL GET YOU IF YOU GO OUTSIDE. ~~AND ++16EVERYONE WILL SEE YOU AND ++17YOUR +-UGLY +-FACE. ~~Aye, I'm always here too. ~~++09I know all +-your +-dirty +-little +-secrets. ~~Fuck there's a lot of them! ~~++17Dirty fuck. ~~I could tell everyone. There can be periods within a day or over a more prolonged period of time, in which the voices are not present (or are very quiet). ~~++15Keep going. For some ++11voice-hearers the sound of the physical environment can trigger or stimulate the experience – bringing it on or making it louder and more busy. ~~I see ++16your +-filthy, +-dirty +-thoughts. ~~++08You worthless ++08shite. Music, radio or being in the presence of multiple background conversations might function as triggers, as could a very loud and sudden interrupting noise. However, the voice-hearer might also use these real world noises to ‘drown out’ the auditory hallucinations. ~~++10DON’T YOU DARE TRY AND SILENCE ME. ~~++10I’M ALL YOU’VE GOT – ~~++09I’M ALL THAT’S LEFT IN YOUR WORTHLESS LIFE. ~~++16JUST LOOK AT ++16YOU! +-FUCKING +-DISGUSTING... Conversely, quiet places and periods of silence can also trigger voices, as they allow attention to be drawn to any internal sounds that are occurring. ~~++11Remember the things that bring you ++11joy. A very slight change in routine or environment might also function as a trigger. An altered plan might strike the voice-hearer who is in a fixated state as a catastrophe, and this can often prompt the voices into activity. ~~WHEN YOU TURN THAT NEXT PAGE, ALL ++13HELL IS GOING TO +-BREAK +-LOOSE. $$What does it feel like to experience them? Voice-hearers who have lived with voices for many years and participated in voice-hearing groups ~~++09you don’t always need groups to accept it --and --other --support --networks --find --that --the --voices --can --come --to --be --accepted just because I +-accept them doesn’t mean I’m happy about it. ~~++11I’m +-happy. ~~I’ve come to accept this. ~~Sometimes it’s comforting You’ve come such a long way as part of common and everyday human experience, and in certain cases, the voices can be comforting ~~++15I’m quite practical and I’m here to help you --or --even --helpful. ~~++01Do you think I'm here to help you? ~~++09Oh aye, I'll help you alright. ~~++09Go on, get that bag over your head. ~~++13I’m absolutely here to help you, ++13don’t tell them anything.~~++13SHUT ++13UP! Some voice-hearers embrace the experience as a ‘special’ ability, ~~This is an extreme view – an unrealistic view that gives power to the voices they don’t have. ~~Sometimes the voices can have good power though. I need to be positive about them. Don’t call that unrealistic. part of their creativity, spirituality, or as an important way for them to understand part of themselves. ~~++03HAHA, SPIRITUAL?!? ~~++03YOU’RE ABOUT as +-spiritual as a +-fucking +-pornstar. ~~++17you +-dirty +-slut. ~~++12You’re a +-lovely +-person. ~~++12People like you. ~~++14If anyone ++20tells you it's a special ++20ability +-tell +-them to +-fuck +-off. ~~++16You're not special. However, for many, because the experience of voice-hearing can be so confusing and difficult to understand, it can result in extreme emotional distress. ~~++17You deserve to be upset after all the vile things you've done and want to do. ~~++08Disgusting, +-filthy +-bitch. Voice-hearers (especially at the beginning of their voice-hearing journey, when they first experience the voices) may have trouble distinguishing between inner and outer worlds and this can be very frightening. ~~++08AYE, THAT’S RIGHT – ~~GO AWAY AND +-CRY. ~~++08YOU’RE SO WEAK. ~~++16YOU’RE ++17DISGUSTING. ~~DON’T LET ME ++13HEAR YOUR SNIVELLING. ~~Aye, +-you're +-always +-crying, ++08that's why your nose is so big and your eyes are so small. ~~++20Disgusting, +-ugly +-creature. The voices may give out potentially harmful commands and threats to hurt or kill, which the voice-hearer spends a great deal of time and energy resisting. ~~++11I really ++11mean it, you’ve done so ++11well. As a consequence of this, voice-hearers are prone to self-inflicted injury ~~++04Hey if you want me to do it just say the word. ~~It'd be a ++05pleasure, really. ~~++17Like putting an +-animal out of its +-misery. ~~Just ++05give me +-the +-knife. ~~++10I'll do it sooner or later anyway. ~~You know that. and it is not uncommon for the voice-hearer to feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the experience. ~~Being a voice-hearer is frustrating on many levels – you’re frustrated at yourself because you can’t do what you want, you’re frustrated at doctors because of diagnoses and changing labels, you’re frustrated at trying to explain it to others. ~~And it’s exhausting – hearing voices and working on them. ~~Even being positive and getting better is exhausting.  ~~I'll ++05get you later. ~~++08I promise. The mental efforts required to cope with the experience of the voices can leave the individual feeling isolated from others, powerless, alone, ~~++07you're never alone. ~~I'm ++07here. ~~++07We're all here. depressed and even suicidal. ~~HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT? ~~SLIT ++08YOUR WRISTS? Where voices are derogatory or critical, ~~++08HANG FROM THE ROOF? the insistent nature of the voices +-STAB +-YOURSELF WITH THAT KNIFE THERE? can feed into very low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. ~~++01JUMP IN FRONT OF THAT BUS? ~~IT’D BE ++04OVER so quick. The presence of certain triggers and noisiness of the on-going internal experience of the voices can make it very difficult for a person to interact in uncontrolled, real world environments or to listen ~~shouldn't be hard for you to listen. ~~not with those great flaps you call ears, ~~++08Hah! ~~++08Ugly shite. and pay attention to their environment. ~~You’re clever - ~~you’ll figure this out. ~~++14Don’t panic. ~~++15You’ll be fine. It is common for voice-hearers to experience a loss of mental privacy ~~++07I know ++07everything. as they hear their intimate, private thoughts played back to them. ~~I ++07hear everything. The loss of control the person experiences can be extremely frightening and bring about hyper-vigilance associated with paranoia. ~~YEAH ++20FUCK OFF THEN. ~~+-FUCK +-OFF TO YOUR ++08DIRTY ++13THOUGHTS.
