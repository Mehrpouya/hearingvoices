 "text": "++Voice-hearing experiences are extremely varied and as such are difficult to characterise or categorise. The ++types of voices that +-are experienced and their effect will be as varied as the people who ++experience them. The following are some forms of experience that appear to be ++common or shared between a number of ++voice-hearers, although this is not by any means an exhaustive list, and should only act as a starting point for understanding the breadth and type of experience: Often voice-hearers describe the presence of multiple voices – this could be a number of voices that are overheard talking to one another about the person, it could also be like hearing a crowd of people talking to each other or all at once. Sometimes there may only be once voice, or one prominent voice, while other voices mumble inaudibly in the background. The voices might be difficult or impossible to tune in or listen to, and may be prominent at different times (like different visitors popping in across the day) Noise, chaos and distraction are commonly experienced. The voices can speak directly to the individual them in the third person. They may make a running commentary on the person's actions or activities.They may also make no comment or interaction with the individual at all, but carry on their own dialogues.Sometimes the voices are confusingly indistinguishable from a person’s own thoughts, i.e. it is difficult to distinguish what is ‘my voice’ and what is the ‘other voice’ Although they are often termed ‘auditory hallucinations’, voices are not always audible, i.e. experienced in the same way that voices in the external environment might be. This is the case sometimes or for some people. However, for many others the voices are more of a ‘sense’ of a voice, or are distinguishably ‘internal’ voices. For example, people who have been deaf from birth can also experience voice-hearing. This is often understood as the sense of someone signing rather than speaking audibly. The voices can also be accompanied by visual or tactile sensations – they can be sensed appearing on walls or overwritten in the environment. Voices can be recognisable – i.e. the voice of someone known to the hearer such as a family member, past acquaintance or famous person, living or dead – or the voice of a stranger. When the voices are those of a loved one or a living person, this can lead to feelings of paranoia. The voices vary in volume and intensity and are sometimes described as distorted, tinny, far away, normal, very close, disturbingly loud and distracting. They also may not be recognisable voices but more like sounds, i.e. murmuring, crying, humming, singing. Voice-hearers report hearing short phrases, whole sentences or seemingly endless monologues in a range of tones from sarcastic, angry and taunting to more benevolent modes of expression. The voices can be critical, compulsive, neutral, or supportive and encouraging, but critical or aggressive and threatening voices are most common among voice-hearers. Frequently the voices give running commentary on the thoughts or actions of the hearer and comment on, react to or critique them. These voices may also give out potentially harmful suggestions or commands and threaten to hurt or kill the person. The experience is usually very distressing, but it is not always negative. A minority of voice-hearers experience encouraging or complimentary voices, having learned to listen without judgment over a prolonged period of time and often with the help of peer support. The experience can be viewed as a ‘special gift’ akin to Shamanism, prophecy or spiritualism in other cultures or communities. Because the voices can be considered representative of aspects of the voice-hearer’s self or past experiences that have been repressed and externalised, or as understandable reactions to difficult life experiences, the content of what they say will inevitably differ from unique individual to unique individual and often represent the individual’s",
