            "text":"The research upon which this guide is based was collected by a cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional group of researchers, you mean Gail, Jo and Debbie? Don’t pretend you’re not here, we all know you’re here. We’re all here. voice-hearers aren’t we more than that to you? [You know doctors don’t use this term]  and their hearing voices group facilitators. across a residential weekend and a number of follow-up sessions. Members of these groups range from schizophrenics ‘schizophrenic’ is a damaging and stigmatising label that we reject. There is a lot of evidence that it isn’t even one diagnosis. Maybe that’s easy for you to say, you know, maybe you regard yourself as such an expert as somebody who never had a diagnosis or possible experience of schizophrenia, as somebody who has the right to say that, but I think that’s a really irresponsible thing to say to sufferers you presume to know we all ‘suffer’? Do you pity us? of bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, certain personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder do you realise how many times you are saying the word ‘disorder’ here? and a number of un-diagnosed or not yet formulated conditions as well as those with none (such as the recently bereaved). Following calls in the literature for research into verbal auditory hallucination I wince when you say “hallucination”. It makes us sound deranged, out of control. It takes the voices out of the range of common human experience to somewhere pathological. It also suggests everyone ‘hears’ something, which isn’t the case. It also suggests the voices aren’t real. The voices are real. Call it “VOICE-HEARING”  that listens and takes into account the voices of those who experience it, this companion was co-authored in conjunction with Hearing Voices Network and related groups from across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. These are a loosely affiliated networks of locally-run self-help do you use this description ‘self-help’ to make us more dismissible? Pop-psychology nutters? groups who believe in addressing voice-hearing as a form of common human experience Yes! That’s it! and aim to find ways of listening to and living with voices. The research here is based on a hypothesis that voice-hearers are experts in their own conditions and that they hold a great repository of what Foucault would refer to as ‘subjugated knowledge’ (1980) are you trying to exclude us with these fancy terms? What exactly do you mean? i.e. knowledge that serves as a challenge to the dominant knowledge of institutions or social practices and is therefore marginalised by those authorities. The expertise of the voice-hearing community may serve to challenge institutions or social practices, but this research attempts to welcome such challenges, Do you really welcome this challenge? How far are you willing to accept it? Is there anything you won’t hear? believing that the subjugation of knowledge results in the stigmatisation, marginalisation and isolation of those whose voices are not heard. The mental health and wellbeing of those who are silenced are negatively affected. This has been shown to be the case by researchers who recommend (collaborative) action research and community-based participatory research (Carr, 2007; Coleman et al, 2009; Bolam et al, 2010; Banks and Armstrong et al, 2014). Taking such an approach to this research is an attempt to allow for progress in developing new insights, approaches and methodologies with relation to voice-hearing experiences. We really need those. But are you ready to listen to every voice? Really ready?  "
