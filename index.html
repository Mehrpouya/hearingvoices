      Listening to Voices is a research project that tries to understand how we can listen to voices that we find difficult, disruptive or challenging, whether these seem to come from inside or outside ourselves. It has been created by voice-hearers, academics and independent artists who are interested in asking why and how we silence voices in ourselves or others and how we might help increase understanding about the experience of hearing voices. Together we have created a companion to voice-hearing (?), an interactive text, a sound piece and some other written pieces about listening to voices.
    </section>
    <section class="marginTop30 lead text-justify">
      Amongst other things, we hope that the companion that has been collaboratively created will help to increase understanding about the experience of hearing voices and help everyone to learn better skills for listening to voices that often go unheard.

      Listen (If You Dare): <s>An Unlikely</s> Companion to Voice-Hearing is a radical new text about voice-hearing experiences. It explores what it is like to hear voices and attempts to help the reader experience something of that too. It also tries to understand how we can listen better to those voices that we find difficult, disruptive or challenging, whether these seem to come from inside or outside ourselves.

They reflect real experience and contain explicit content. For anyone who hears voices (particularly if this is a new experience) or loves someone who hears voices, reading it may be difficult or triggering.

        Listen (If You Dare) was co-authored by members of Time and Space Hearing Voices group, Hearing Voices Belfast, Hearing Voices Ireland, the project researchers, sound artist Pedro Rebelo and designer Sara Nevay. They met together at a weekend retreat to reflect on, share and broaden their experiences of listening and being listened to. This retreat and the follow up discussions resulted in the production of this booklet in November 2015.

She is the author of Northern Irish Poetry and Theology (Palgrave, 2014) and is one of the editors of The Irish Review. Gail’s research interests are in modern Irish and British poetry, in particular the politics of literary form. Her work on lyric disintegration, violence, revision and repetition underpins her interest in voice-hearing experience and disrupted form. She has enjoyed the opportunity to work with voice-hearers from Scotland and Ireland in co-producing the many facets of ‘Listening to Voices’.</p>
