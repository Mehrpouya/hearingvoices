      Listening to Voices: Creative Disruptions with the Hearing Voices Network is a research project that tries to understand how we can listen to voices that we find difficult, disruptive or challenging, whether these seem to come from inside or outside ourselves. It has been created by voice-hearers, academics and independent artists who are interested in asking why and how we silence voices in ourselves or others and how we might help increase understanding about the experience of hearing voices. Together we have created a companion to voice-hearing - Listen (If you Dare) - an interactive web version of the companion and a sound piece.
    </section>
    <section class="marginTop30 lead text-justify">
      These works are challenging and are intended to raise awareness, empathy and understanding about the nature of voice-hearing experiences among support providers, families, friends and the wider public. They create space not only for voice-hearers, but for the voices they hear to be made visible and audible. These works seek to subvert and disrupt traditional ways of thinking about voice-hearing experiences and the silencing strategies that stop us from listening. We have begun creatively applying what we have learnt through co-producing these works to different forms of research (see Further Research section). By doing this we hope to encourage the practice and develop the skill of listening to voices that often go unheard.

      Listen (If You Dare): A<s>n Unlikely</s> Companion to Voice-Hearing is a radical new text about voice-hearing experiences. It explores what it is like to hear voices and attempts to help the reader experience something of that too. It also tries to understand how we can listen better to those voices that we find difficult, disruptive or challenging, whether these seem to come from inside or outside ourselves.
    </section>
    <section class="lead text-justify">
      Listen (If You Dare) was co-authored by members of Time and Space Hearing Voices group, Hearing Voices Belfast, Hearing Voices Ireland, the project researchers, sound artist Pedro Rebelo and designer Sara Nevay. They met together at a weekend retreat to reflect on, share and broaden their experiences of listening and being listened to. This retreat and the follow up discussions resulted in the production of this booklet in November 2015.

      <span class="text-greyBack"><strong>Warning:</strong></span> Some of the text and voices in the Listen (If You Dare) may be disturbing. They reflect real experience and contain explicit content. For anyone who hears voices (particularly if this is a new experience) or loves someone who hears voices, reading it may be difficult or triggering.

          Sound Piece
        </h2>
      </section>

      <section class="lead text-justify">
        Created by Pedro Rebelo and research participants, the Listening to Voices sound piece is an immersive audio work employing three dimensional binaural audio techniques and is to be experienced with headphones. The piece aims to delve into the experiential phenomenon of hearing voices.
      </section>
      <section class="lead text-justify">
        All vocal materials for the piece were gathered during a retreat with voice-hearers in 2015 during which activities focusing on listening were conducted, as well as interviews and field recording sessions. The work takes the listener through different sound environments and introduces the experience of listening to voices through short narrative fragments, descriptions articulating how the voices relate to the acoustic world and enacted performances.
      </section>
      <section class="lead text-justify">
        The work is structured in four sections. A long introduction presents the experience of voice-hearing through short personal stories and ends with an enactment of the experience of hearing negative voices. The remaining two sections are episodes (“Lab” and “Restaurant”) which focus on the relationship between voices and the acoustic environment. “Lab” features accounts which attempt to describe the phenomenon of hearing voices and reflects on the challenges the medical profession has in understanding this condition. “Restaurant” explores how voices are triggered by everyday sound environments and often arise out of saturated listening experiences. The piece ends with a third episode “Night” which is based on an enacted performance exploring the role of positive voices and thoughts.
      </section>
      <section class="lead text-justify">
        The enacted performances were fully improvised and featured only members of the voice-hearing community. We would like to thank the extreme generosity, sincerity and positive energy of all participants. This piece would have not been possible without their contribution and guidance.
      </section>
      <section class="lead text-justify">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> The piece includes explicit content and adult language. Some listeners may find the voices featured in the piece disturbing.

      <section class="marginTop30 lead text-justify">
        Many projects focused on mental health and wellbeing and have used creative writing or other forms of art-making as a method for members of community partnership groups to
document and explore their experiences. While innovative in their attention to artistic medium, such projects can still struggle not to employ a top-down model in which the academic researcher gives the ‘subject’ communities of healthcare clients an opportunity for creative expression, without availing of the same opportunity in reverse. In other words, the outputs created by community partners are not often allowed to offer appropriate challenge to the academics inviting such stories that would enable a non-hierarchical critical collaboration.
      </section>
      <section class="marginTop30 lead text-justify">
        This project intervenes in this field of activity by showing that the value of art-making and creative practice can be disruptive as well as therapeutic; that the arts can challenge and provoke, as well as document and soothe. It seeks to break down traditional boundaries between practice-led or practice-based research and other forms of investigation. For this reason, further research will focus on the creation of academic (and other) outputs that allow themselves to be creatively disrupted.
